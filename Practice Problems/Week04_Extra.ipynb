Priority Queue: Create a class called `PriorityQueue` to represent priority queue data structure. Priority Queue has the same basic operations as stack and queues with two differences:\n","* Items are pushed into a priority queue with a numeric score, called a *cost*.\n","* When it is time to pop an item, the item in the priority queue with the least cost is returned and removed from the priority queue.
